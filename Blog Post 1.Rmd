#For my anaylsis I chose to look at forest fire data in Montesinho national park in Portugal. The information include the X and Y coordinates within the park which has been added for reference. Information on temperature, humidity, wind, rain and burn area.FFMC is a measure of fuel moisture in the shade on the forest floor. DMC is the dryness of the decomposed organic matter, and DC is a measure of the drought conditons. ISI is the fire spread index. I decided to do a hiearchical clustering analysis to see what insights could be draw.

library(dplyr)


fire <- read.csv("/Users/amiroftadeh/Downloads/forestfires.csv")
fire<-fire[-c(206,517)]

for(i in 1:2) {fire[,i] <- as.numeric(fire[,i])}
for(i in 5:13) {fire[,i] <- as.numeric(fire[,i])}
newfire <- fire[,c(1:2,5:13)]



newfire<-(as.data.frame(newfire))
newfire <-scale(newfire)

d <- dist(newfire, method = "euclidean") # distance matrix
fit <- hclust(d, method="complete")
plot(fit); abline(h=15, col="red"); rect.hclust(fit, k=8, border="red")


clusters <- cutree(fit, k=8)

trees <-cbind(fire, clusters)

newfire1<- cbind(newfire,clusters)
as.data.frame(newfire1) %>% group_by(clusters) %>% summarise(n())

#when looking at the clusters by counts, clusters 5,6,7 contained only one or two datapoints and were excluded from analysis. 

summary(trees[which(trees$clusters==1),])

#These fires occur in the central most part of the park. The also occur in mostly in March or Feburary. The average temperature was around 12.2 C and humidity of 46%. This is interesting because would expect hot temperature and low humidity during  wildfires. The DC measure is 147.4, extreme drought coniditions occur 800. The winds conditons were mild and so was the ISI. This leads one to think that these were controlled burns to allow for the forest to be rejuvenated. Fires under these condition are unlikely to burn wildly and are easy to maintain. 

summary(trees[which(trees$clusters==2),])
#These fires occur in the mid to late summer months, with 78 points falling between July, August, and September. The locations of these fires are somewhat centrally located but more south eastern than in cluster 1. The temperature is 23 C and a humidity level of 35.9%. The DC is averaging 636.5, This indicates drought like conditions. These fires are occuring during peak conditons for fires.


summary(trees[which(trees$clusters==3),])
#This cluster is the largest of the clusters created. The majority of these occur in august and september. These fires occur in west central portion of the park. The temperature 20 C and humidity level of 45.7%. The DC levels are around 668. This group of fires occurs happen in slightly cooler conditions than cluster 2 but it is also drier. 

summary(trees[which(trees$clusters==4),])
#The fires in this cluster occur in the central north eastern section of the park. There was no set of months with these fires. The temperature is slightly cooler at 15.9 C and an average humidity of 57% . The DC is at 395.6 indicating dry but not drought conditions.
